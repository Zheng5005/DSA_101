## What is a Binary Search Tree?
It follow thw some logic as binary trees, but the values are arranged in s certain order, the root node should be greater than the left child, but less than the right child

## Tree Traversal
There's a lot of ways to do this:
- Depth Firts Traversal (DFS)
    - In-order
    - Post-order
    - Pre-order
- Breadth First Traversal (Level Order Traversal or BFS)

## What's the complexity?
O(n) -> Worst case
