## What is this?
Is a repository meant for anyone that wants to learn Data Structures and Algorithms and wants to guide themselves with some example code

## In what language?
The goal is to have multiple languages in order to smooth the way for anyone that stumbles with this repository

Languages included:
- Python
- Go
- Javascript

## Big O Notation
Thoughout the repository you'll see terms like Linear complexity, and notation like O(n), but what does it mean?

this is Big O notation, this describes the performance of an Algorithm as the amount of data increases, it counts the necesary steps in order to run a Algorithms

The notations are: (from fastest to lowest)
- O(1) -> Meaning constant time
- O(log n) -> Logarithmic time
- O(n) -> Linear Time
- O(n log n) -> Quasilinear time
- O(n^2) -> Quadratic time
- O(n!) -> Factorial time

## Recursion
Another concept you'll see is recursion, is commonly used with advance sorting Algorithms and navigating trees.

Recursion apply the result of a procedure, to a procedure, a recursive method calls itself, this divides a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original.
