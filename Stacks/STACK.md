## What is a Stack?
It's a LIFO(Last In, First Out) data structure that stores objects into a sort of "vertical tower"

## How you add or remove
To add to the top of the list use the .push() method (or the equivalent of this function in your favorite language)

To remove from the top use the .pop() method
