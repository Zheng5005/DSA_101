## What is a Graph?
Is a non-linear data structure that consist of a finite set of **vertices** (also called nodes or points) and a set of **edges** (also called links or arcs) connecting these vertices, normally are represented using 2 main methods
- **Adjacency Matrix**: complexity O(1), but requires a lot more memory
- **Adjacency List**: complexity O(n), more memory efficient 

## Real world examples
- Social networks
- Transportation systems
